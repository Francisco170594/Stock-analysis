# Stock-analysis
## Green energy project

### Overview of the project
 - The purpose of this project was to evaluate the performance of different stocks -in the green power market- throghout the years 2017 and 2018.  This analysis should help our client  to choose the most profitable company in wich to invest.
 - To achieve this, we will use VBA to create a macro that iterates through a list of tickers and retrieves the data concerning total volume (wich reflects trading activity) and  yearly return of each stock.
 - In order to work with a larger dataset, our code should be refactor and bring a solution in less time than the original one.
